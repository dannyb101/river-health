        <p>Every time you start a new calculation, many of the fields in the form are already filled out for you. You can change any of these values on the <a href="/defaults">defaults page</a>. The application comes with the defaults set to values obtained from the Environment Agency’s document entitled <a href="http://www.hwa.uk.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MP_INQ_57.1-WRc-2005-compiled-extracts.pdf" target="_blank">Default and Sensitivity Values for Use in Simplified UMP Modelling Studies</a>. If you make a change to the defaults but later decide you would like to set them back to the values from that document, you can press <i>Reset Defaults</i> which is also on the <a href="/defaults">defaults</a> page.</p>
        <p>Many of the fields in the form are not currently used in the calculation outlined above. These are the parts of the form that are entitled River Dimensions, River Parameters, Other River Parameters and Aeration Equation. One field in the box entitled Simulation, number of years, is also unused in the calculation. These will be used if the application is later developed to calculate the Fundamental Intermittent Standards (FIS).</p>
        <p>When you click a river station in the NRFA dropdown, the application fetches river flow data from the NRFA’s own <a href="https://nrfaapps.ceh.ac.uk/nrfa/nrfa-api.html" target="_blank">database</a>. According to the NRFA, this is a test service and the results that come back may change before the service becomes operational. If this happens, we warn the user that this may make the NRFA dropdown defective.</p>
